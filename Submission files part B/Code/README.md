# Unity Project - C# Scripts
Project Overview
This repository reflects the C# scripts attached to our Unity project. These scripts are essential components that drive the functionality and gameplay of the project.

# Version Control
For this project, we used Unity Version Control, a version control management system provided by Unity Cloud Services. This system is designed specifically for Unity projects, ensuring better integration and management of the files and assets that are unique to Unity development.

Unity Version Control offers more efficient handling of scene changes, prefab modifications, and large binary assets, which traditional version control systems may struggle with. It's a key part of maintaining the integrity and organization of this project as it evolves.

# Full Project
The complete Unity project is hosted in Unity Cloud. A link to the full project, along with additional assets, will be provided in the final submission.
